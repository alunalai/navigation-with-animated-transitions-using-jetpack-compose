/**
 * Manages the navigation to and from screens in an Android app. Although developed to work primarily with
 * apps that use Jetpack Compose, it can also be used to provided navigation for the older View based system.
 *
 * Navigation Manager is intended to replace Android's own Jetpack navigation system. It is light weight, lets
 * you pass any data type from one screen to another (including objects) and allows easy implementation of
 * animated transitions to and from other screens.
 *
 * Navigation Manager can create and manage the lifecycle of viewmodels for each screen and is the single source
 * of truth for which screen is currently being displayed and tracks the user's navigation path.
 *
 * As a singleton, Navigation Manager should be initialized in your app in a class that inherits from
 * Application, when the app starts up. It remains resident throughout the lifetime of your app and will
 * retain the state of a screen in the event of screen being recomposed or even if the activity hosting
 * the screen gets killed.
